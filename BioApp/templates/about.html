    <h1 style="text-align:center">Dedicated to my mother</h1>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Many of you probably know my mother, Norma. Well this website is dedicated to how much my mother pushed me to become who I am today. If you don't know by now, I'm her second oldest and also her second son, Leiver Anthony Avila. It's funny how life works and it all just happens at a blink of an eye, especially with how life begins and ends. She was and still is such an important person in my life, she is also the reason why I pursued to become a software developer. For those who do not know what a software developer is, Let me make it easy and as simple as I can. A software developer is someone who writes code for many kinds of software. Which is how I made this website you're currently looking at; She always believed in everything I did and continuously pushed me to always better than before. My mother loved my siblings and I so much, even my niece Emiliana, was able to feel how much her grandma loved her. She was beyond happy for all of us and had a smile while we were around her, especially with our accomplishments. And for that I am again, dedicating this website, and also this final project for school(which I officially graduated on June 18, 2021), to her.</h3>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Mom, thank you for showing me love, for believing in me, for being the best mom anyone in this world could ask for. I miss you everyday and will love you forever. Till we meet again.</h3>
